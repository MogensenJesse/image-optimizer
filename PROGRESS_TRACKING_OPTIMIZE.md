## Implementation Plan

### 1. Remove Memory Metrics Overhead

[x] Remove memory metrics collection
   Short description: Remove unnecessary memory tracking functionality since memory usage is negligible
   Prerequisites: None
   Files modified:
   - src-tauri/src/processing/batch/processor.rs
   - src-tauri/src/processing/batch/metrics.rs
   - src-tauri/src/processing/mod.rs
   Code removed:
   ```rust
   // From batch/processor.rs:
   - Removed get_available_memory() function
   - Removed memory_metrics usage in process()
   - Removed memory-related calculations in calculate_batch_size()
   
   // From batch/metrics.rs:
   - Removed BatchMemoryMetrics struct and implementation
   
   // From mod.rs:
   - Removed BatchMemoryMetrics re-export
   ```
   [x] Cleanup after removing code:
    - Updated function signatures to remove memory metrics
    - Updated worker pool to handle batch results without memory metrics
    - Removed memory metrics from benchmarking system

### 2. Optimize Task Validation

[x] Implement efficient validation
   Short description: Replace per-task spawning with chunked validation and remove unnecessary cloning
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify:
   - src-tauri/src/processing/batch/processor.rs
   Code to add:
   ```rust
   async fn validate_tasks(&self, tasks: &[ImageTask]) -> OptimizerResult<()> {
       const VALIDATION_CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 50;
       
       for chunk in tasks.chunks(VALIDATION_CHUNK_SIZE) {
           let futures: Vec<_> = chunk.iter()
               .map(|task| validate_task(task))
               .collect();
           futures::future::try_join_all(futures).await?;
       }
       Ok(())
   }
   ```
   [x] Cleanup:
    - Removed old validation implementation
    - Updated error handling for chunked validation

### 3. Implement Process Warmup

[x] Add process pool warmup
   Short description: Implement process warmup to reduce cold start overhead
   Prerequisites: None
   Files modified:
   - src-tauri/src/processing/pool/process_pool.rs
   - src-tauri/src/processing/optimizer.rs
   - src-tauri/src/worker/pool.rs
   - src-tauri/src/core/state.rs
   Code added:
   ```rust
   // In ProcessPool impl:
   pub async fn warmup(&self) -> OptimizerResult<()> {
       let warmup_count = self.max_size;
       let mut handles = Vec::with_capacity(warmup_count);
       
       // Spawn warmup processes
       for i in 0..warmup_count {
           let handle = tokio::spawn({
               let pool = self.clone();
               async move {
                   let cmd = pool.acquire().await?;
                   cmd.output().await?;
                   pool.release().await;
                   Ok::<_, OptimizerError>(())
               }
           });
           handles.push(handle);
       }
       
       futures::future::try_join_all(handles).await?;
       Ok(())
   }
   ```
   [x] Integration:
    - Updated ImageOptimizer to call warmup during initialization
    - Made ImageOptimizer::new async to support warmup
    - Updated WorkerPool to handle async initialization
    - Modified AppState to handle async worker pool creation

### 4. Pipeline Processing Implementation

[ ] Add pipeline processing
   Short description: Implement pipeline stages for overlapped I/O and processing
   Prerequisites: Previous optimizations completed
   Files to modify:
   - src-tauri/src/processing/batch/processor.rs
   Code structure:
   ```rust
   struct PipelineStage {
       read_queue: VecDeque<ImageTask>,
       process_queue: VecDeque<(ImageTask, Vec<u8>)>,
       write_queue: VecDeque<(ImageTask, Vec<u8>)>,
   }
   
   impl BatchProcessor {
       async fn pipeline_process(&self, tasks: Vec<ImageTask>) -> OptimizerResult<Vec<OptimizationResult>> {
           let mut stage = PipelineStage::new();
           let (read_tx, read_rx) = mpsc::channel(50);
           let (process_tx, process_rx) = mpsc::channel(50);
           let (write_tx, write_rx) = mpsc::channel(50);
           
           // Spawn pipeline stages
           let read_handle = self.spawn_read_stage(tasks, read_tx);
           let process_handle = self.spawn_process_stage(read_rx, process_tx);
           let write_handle = self.spawn_write_stage(process_rx, write_tx);
           
           // Collect results
           let results = write_rx.collect().await;
           
           // Wait for all stages to complete
           try_join!(read_handle, process_handle, write_handle)?;
           
           Ok(results)
       }
   }
   ```
