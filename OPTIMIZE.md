  - Added range checks in Duration::new()
  - Added safety checks in Duration::new_unchecked()
  - Added is_valid() method for runtime validation
- [✅] Validate percentage calculations:
  - Added safety checks in Percentage::new_unchecked()
  - Added warning messages for out-of-range values
  - Added is_valid() method for runtime validation
- [✅] Add range checks for worker IDs:
  - Added MAX_WORKER_COUNT constant
  - Added validate_worker_id() method
  - Added validation in worker capacity management
- [✅] Add builder pattern for safe construction:
  - Using Option<T> for validated construction

  - Added unchecked constructors with safety guards

### Code Cleanup 🔄
- [✅] Remove Unused Code:
  - Removed redundant format_duration function
  - Cleaned up unused imports
  - Removed duplicate code in worker pool
- [✅] Clean up Debug Derives:
  - Kept necessary Debug derives for tracing
  - Removed redundant derives where not needed
  - Added documentation explaining derive requirements
- [✅] Document Public APIs:
  - Added documentation for all public types
  - Added documentation for public methods
  - Added explanatory comments for complex logic
- [ ] Remove Unnecessary Public Modifiers:
  - Review and adjust field visibility
  - Review and adjust method visibility
  - Document intentionally public APIs

## Notes
- After every step: Check if all imports, type references, function calls, etc regarding the step are updated in the rest of the backend.
- Consider impact on performance when adding safety checks
- Document any assumptions or limitations in the code
- Keep error messages consistent and user-friendly
