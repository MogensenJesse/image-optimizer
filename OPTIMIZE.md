## Progress Summary
🔄 = In Progress
⚠️ = Blocked/Has Issues
✅ = Completed

Current Status:
- 🔄 Benchmarking Refactor & Error Handling Enhancement

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Benchmarking Separation
#### Phase 1: Create BenchmarkingDecorator
[] Create new file `src-tauri/src/benchmarking/decorator.rs`
[] Define BenchmarkingDecorator struct and traits
[] Implement basic timing and metrics collection

#### Phase 2: Move Benchmarking Logic
[] Identify and list all benchmarking code in WorkerPool
[] Move timing-related code to decorator
[] Update WorkerPool to use decorator
[] Ensure all metrics are properly transferred

#### Phase 3: Consolidate Timing Logic
[] Create centralized timing utilities in benchmarking module
[] Standardize time measurement approaches
[] Implement time validation improvements

### 2. Integration & Testing
[] Update all module imports
[] Fix any broken references
[] Verify benchmarking accuracy

## Completed Tasks

## Notes
- After every step: Check if all imports, type references, function calls, etc regarding the step are updated in the rest of the backend.
- Ensure backward compatibility during the refactor
- Monitor performance impact of changes
- Keep error messages user-friendly while adding technical details in logs
