# Parallel Processing Implementation Roadmap

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Limitations
1. **Sequential Processing**
- One image at a time
- Blocking operations
- Underutilized system resources

### System Constraints
1. **Node.js Sidecar**
- Single-threaded main event loop
- Limited by Sharp's concurrent operations
- Memory usage per instance

2. **Core Process Management**
- Leverage Tauri's multi-process architecture
- Implement proper IPC channels for worker communication
- Use Rust async runtime for concurrent operations

2. **Tauri IPC**
- Command invocation overhead
- Serialization/deserialization costs

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: Security Setup
1. **Trust Boundaries**
- Enforce proper IPC boundaries between frontend and backend
- Implement capability-based security for parallel operations
- Add CSP headers for worker communication

2. **Resource Access**
- Configure proper scopes for parallel file access
- Implement permission sets for batch operations
- Add capability checks for concurrent operations

### Phase 1: Concurrent Processing Pool

1. **Worker Pool Setup**
```javascript
const MAX_CONCURRENT = Math.min(
  navigator.hardwareConcurrency - 1, 
  4
);
```

2. **Queue Management**
- Implement priority queue for images
- Track active workers
- Monitor memory usage

3. **Progress Tracking**
- Aggregate results from parallel operations
- Real-time UI updates
- Error handling per worker

### Phase 2: Backend Changes

1. **Rust Command Handler**
```rust
pub async fn optimize_batch(
    app: tauri::AppHandle,
    paths: Vec<String>,
    settings: ImageSettings,
    batch_size: usize
) -> Result<Vec<OptimizationResult>>

// Add channel-based progress updates
pub async fn optimize_batch_with_progress(
    app: tauri::AppHandle,
    paths: Vec<String>, 
    settings: ImageSettings,
    progress: tauri::ipc::Channel
) -> Result<Vec<OptimizationResult>>
```

2. **Sidecar Modifications**
- Instance pooling
- Memory management
- Resource cleanup

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

1. **Batch Processing**
```javascript
const processBatch = async (images, concurrency) => {
  const queue = [...images];
  const active = new Set();
  const results = [];
  
  while (queue.length || active.size) {
    // Process next batch
  }
};
```

2. **Progress Management**
- Individual file progress
- Batch progress
- Error handling
- Cancel/pause support

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
1. **Monitoring**
- Track memory usage per worker
- Implement automatic throttling
- Garbage collection triggers

2. **Throttling**
- Dynamic concurrency adjustment
- Batch size optimization
- Memory pressure detection

### Error Handling
1. **Graceful Degradation**
- Individual file failure isolation
- Automatic retries
- Fallback to sequential processing

2. **IPC Error Management**
- Handle channel disconnections
- Implement proper error serialization
- Add structured error logging

3. **State Recovery**
- Implement state persistence for long operations
- Add resume capability after crashes
- Track partial progress

## Testing Strategy

1. **Performance Testing**
- Baseline comparisons

- CPU utilization metrics

2. **Integration Testing**
- Use Tauri's test utilities
- Implement WebDriver tests for UI
- Add mock IPC handlers for testing

3. **Security Testing**
- Validate capability boundaries
- Test permission enforcement

## Monitoring

1. **Metrics**
- Processing time per image
- Memory usage per worker
- Queue length
- Error rates

2. **Tauri-Specific Monitoring**
- Use Tauri's event system for real-time metrics
- Implement structured logging with tauri-plugin-log
- Add DevTools integration for debugging
