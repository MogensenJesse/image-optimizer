## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhance DirectExecutor with Warmup Support

[✅] Add warmup method to DirectExecutor
   Short description: Create a new warmup method in DirectExecutor that processes a minimal image to initialize the Sharp sidecar
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify:
   - src-tauri/src/processing/sharp/direct_executor.rs
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   ```rust
   // Add to impl DirectExecutor block
   
   /// Warms up the executor by processing a minimal image task
   /// This helps reduce the cold start penalty for the first real task
   pub async fn warmup(&self) -> OptimizerResult<()> {
       info!("Warming up DirectExecutor...");
       
       // Create a minimal task that will initialize the Sharp pipeline
       // but requires minimal processing time
       let dummy_task = ImageTask::create_warmup_task()?;
       
       // Execute the task but don't care about the result
       // Just need to initialize the Sharp sidecar
       let _ = self.execute_batch(&[dummy_task]).await?;
       
       info!("DirectExecutor warmup completed successfully");
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

           if !input_path.exists() {

## Implementation Notes
- Make changes incrementally, one file at a time
- Test warmup behavior before processing real tasks
- Ensure the warmup task is minimal to avoid slow startup
- Use async to avoid blocking the UI during warmup
- The 1x1 pixel image should be less than 1KB for fast processing
- Consider adding log output to track when the warmup completes

## Completed Tasks

### Resource Preparation (✅)
- Added a 1x1 pixel JPEG file to src-tauri/resources/warmup.jpg for use in the warmup process

### Implementation (✅)
- Added create_warmup_task method to ImageTask in src-tauri/src/core/task.rs
- Added warmup method to DirectExecutor in src-tauri/src/processing/sharp/direct_executor.rs
- Added warmup_executor method to AppState in src-tauri/src/core/state.rs
- Updated main.rs to initialize warmup on application start
- Added performance tracking fields to BenchmarkMetrics to measure warmup benefits

## Findings

### Known Issues:
- Warmup task may fail if the temporary directory is not accessible
- First optimization still has a small delay compared to subsequent ones

### Technical Insights:
- Direct executor with warmup combines the simplicity of direct execution with the performance benefits of warm processes
- The overhead of process pool management exceeded the benefits for small batch sizes
- Warmup is most beneficial when processing many small batches over time
- Performance tracking will help quantify the benefits of warmup in real-world usage
