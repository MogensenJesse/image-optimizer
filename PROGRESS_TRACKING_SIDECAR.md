### 5. Standardize Error Handling

[‚úÖ] Create consistent error handling strategy

## Implementation Notes
- Make changes incrementally, one file at a time
- Keep error messages consistent with existing ones
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Don't overcomplicate things, keep it simple and functional
- Ensure proper cleanup after each code move
- Test each change to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality
- The sharp-sidecar project is a Node.js application, so ensure compatibility with CommonJS module system

### Technical Insights:
- The project uses a worker thread model for parallelization
- Sharp is the primary image processing library
- The codebase is organized into clear modules:
  - processing: Image optimization logic
  - utils: Helper functions and logging
  - workers: Thread management
  - config: Format-specific settings
- The sidecar communicates with the main Tauri application through stdout/stderr
- Progress reporting is handled through a specialized messaging system
- Test scripts now properly capture both stdout and stderr, with debug messages going to stdout
- Communication between workers and the main thread happens via messages with specific types ("progress", "results", etc.)
- Task completion is now correctly tracked and reported in real-time
- Format-specific settings are now centralized in configuration files, eliminating duplication
- Error handling is now more robust with specific error messages for each potential failure point
- Input validation is now performed before processing to prevent errors during optimization
- Error propagation is improved by using throw statements instead of process.exit() calls
