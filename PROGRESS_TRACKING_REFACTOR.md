5. ✅ Implement utility functions module

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Module Structure

[✅] Set up directory structure
   Short description: Create organized folder structure for modular components
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: None
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   ```
   sharp-sidecar/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── workers/
   │   ├── processing/
   │   ├── config/
   │   └── utils/
   ```

### 2. Worker Pool Implementation

[✅] Move worker pool to dedicated module
   Short description: Extract SharpWorkerPool class to its own module
   Prerequisites: Directory structure
   Files to modify: 
   - index.js
   - src/workers/worker-pool.js
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Move SharpWorkerPool class and related code ✅
   - Update imports in index.js ✅
   [✅] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Remove worker pool code from index.js ✅
    - Update worker thread initialization ✅
    - Update error handling references ✅

### 3. Image Processing Logic

[✅] Extract core image processing
   Short description: Move image optimization logic to dedicated module
   Prerequisites: Worker pool implementation
   Files to modify:
   - index.js
   - src/processing/optimizer.js
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Move optimizeImage function and related helpers ✅
   - Create clean processing interface ✅
   [✅] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Remove processing code from index.js ✅
    - Update function calls in worker pool ✅
    - Update error handling ✅

### 4. Format Configuration Management

[✅] Organize format configurations
   Short description: Create a structured configuration system for image format settings
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify:
   - optimizationDefaults.js → src/config/formats/defaults.js
   - src/config/formats/index.js
   - src/config/formats/lossless.js
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   ```
   src/config/formats/
   ├── defaults.js      # Move from optimizationDefaults.js ✅
   ├── lossless.js      # Move getLosslessSettings here ✅
   └── index.js         # Export unified configuration interface ✅
   ```
   [✅] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Delete original optimizationDefaults.js after move ✅
    - Update all imports to use new path ✅
    - Ensure format-specific settings are properly exported ✅
    - Add JSDoc comments for better documentation ✅

### 5. Utility Functions

[✅] Create utilities module
   Short description: Extract common helper functions to utils module
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify:
   - index.js
   - src/utils/index.js
   - src/utils/logger.js
   - src/utils/files.js
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Extract logging utilities ✅
   - Move file handling helpers ✅
   - Create path manipulation utilities ✅
   [✅] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Remove utility functions from other files ✅
    - Update imports across modules ✅
    - Ensure consistent error handling ✅

## Implementation Notes
- Make changes incrementally, one file at a time
- Keep error messages consistent with existing ones
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Don't overcomplicate things, keep it simple and functional
- Ensure proper cleanup after each code move

## Completed Tasks

### Module Structure Setup (✅)
- Created main src directory
- Created workers directory for worker pool implementation

- Added proper JSDoc documentation
- Updated worker initialization path
- Cleaned up main index.js file:
  - Removed duplicate SharpWorkerPool class
  - Fixed duplicate imports
  - Removed redundant worker pool initialization
  - Maintained existing functionality while improving code organization

### Image Processing Implementation (✅)
- Created dedicated optimizer module
- Added proper JSDoc documentation
- Moved image processing logic with clean interface
- Maintained existing functionality
- Improved code organization and readability
- Added proper error handling and logging

### Format Configuration Implementation (✅)
- Created organized format configuration structure
- Separated default and lossless settings
- Added unified configuration interface
- Improved error handling for unsupported formats
- Added proper JSDoc documentation
