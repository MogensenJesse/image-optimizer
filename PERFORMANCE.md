# Image Optimizer Performance Improvements ðŸš€

## Overview
Performance optimization roadmap for the Image Optimizer application, focusing on backend processing efficiency and resource utilization.

## Implementation Priorities
Impact/effort matrix for planned optimizations:

| Priority | Feature | Impact | Effort |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Adaptive Worker Scaling | High | Medium |
| 2 | Smart Task Distribution | High | Medium |
| 3 | Streaming Processing | High | High |
| 4 | Event Optimization | Medium | Low |
| 5 | Result Caching | Medium | Medium |
| 6 | State Optimization | Medium | Medium |
| 7 | Sidecar Communication | Medium | High |
| 8 | Smart Validation | Low | Medium |

## Detailed Implementation Plans

### 1. Adaptive Worker Scaling âš¡

#### Current Implementation
```rust
// In worker/pool.rs
let cpu_count = num_cpus::get();
let worker_count = cpu_count.max(2).min(8);
```
- Static worker count based only on CPU cores
- No runtime adaptation
- Fixed upper/lower bounds (2-8)
- No consideration of system load or memory

#### Prerequisites
```toml
[dependencies]
sysinfo = "0.29"  # System information and metrics
parking_lot = "0.12"  # More efficient synchronization primitives
```

#### Files to Update
1. `src-tauri/src/worker/types.rs`
   - Add worker metrics structures
   - Add scaling configuration types

2. `src-tauri/src/worker/pool.rs`
   - Update WorkerPool struct
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Add scaling logic
   - Modify worker management

3. `src-tauri/src/core/state.rs`
   - Add metrics storage
   - Update pool initialization

4. `src-tauri/src/commands/worker.rs`
   - Add metrics retrieval commands
   - Add scaling control commands

#### Implementation Plan

##### Phase 1: Basic Metrics (`worker/pool.rs`, `worker/types.rs`)
- [ ] Add WorkerMetrics struct for per-worker stats
- [ ] Implement system metrics collection using sysinfo
- [ ] Add queue length tracking to WorkerPool

##### Phase 2: Scaling Logic (`worker/pool.rs`)
- [ ] Add ScalingConfig struct with thresholds
- [ ] Implement adjust_worker_count method
- [ ] Add cooldown using tokio::time
- [ ] Implement memory-based scaling triggers

##### Phase 3: Essential Management (`worker/pool.rs`, `core/state.rs`)
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown to WorkerPool
- [ ] Implement task rebalancing on scale-down
- [ ] Add error recovery in process_batch

##### Phase 4: Monitoring (`commands/worker.rs`)
- [ ] Add get_worker_metrics command
- [ ] Implement basic metrics logging using tracing
- [ ] Add scaling event logging

#### Expected Outcome
- More efficient resource usage
- Better system responsiveness
- Improved error handling
- Simple but effective scaling

#### Technical Notes
- Use parking_lot::Mutex for better performance
- Leverage existing tracing setup for logging
- Keep metrics in memory only
- Use atomic counters where possible
