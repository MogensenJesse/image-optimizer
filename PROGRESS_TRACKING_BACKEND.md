   [‚úÖ] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable):
    - Update any related documentation or comments

### 5. Clean up Unused Imports

[‚úÖ] Review and remove unused imports in benchmarking/metrics.rs
   Short description: The metrics.rs file has imports marked with `#[allow(unused_imports)]`
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src-tauri/src/benchmarking/metrics.rs

   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Review dependencies and remove any that are no longer used
   - Review features to ensure they are all still necessary
   [‚úÖ] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): N/A


## Implementation Notes
- Make changes incrementally, one file at a time
- Test each change to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality
- The benchmark feature should remain as it seems to be a core part of the application
- Keep error messages consistent with existing ones
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Don't overcomplicate things, keep it simple and functional
- Ensure proper cleanup after each code removal


## Completed Tasks

1. Removed redundant code and files:
   - Deleted the unused `worker.rs` file which contained a duplicate implementation of `get_active_tasks`
   - Confirmed no other files were importing or referencing this module
   - The application is now using the implementation in `image.rs` exclusively

2. Cleaned up dead code in core/progress.rs:
   - Removed the following unused methods from the Progress implementation:
     - `with_task_id`
     - `with_worker_id`
     - `with_result`
     - `with_error`
     - `with_metadata`
   - Restored `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes for methods that are used indirectly or kept for API consistency:
     - `from_metrics` - used by trait methods but not externally
     - `report_start`, `report_processing`, `report_complete`, `report_error` - default trait methods
   - This cleanup helps maintain the compiler's warnings about unused code while keeping necessary infrastructure

3. Cleaned up dead code in processing/pool/process_pool.rs:
   - Analyzed methods with `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes in the codebase
   - Verified that `set_batch_size` and `get_max_size` are actually used:
     - `set_batch_size` - used in the BatchProcessor::new method
     - `get_max_size` - used in main.rs for debug logging
   - Restored `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes for these methods to silence false positive warnings from Rust analyzer
   - Kept the `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes for benchmark-related methods that use conditional compilation
   - This ensures proper code documentation while preventing misleading IDE warnings

4. Cleaned up dead code in processing/sharp/types.rs:
   - Removed the unused `Progress` type alias along with its documentation comments
   - The type alias was never used in the codebase, and the core progress type is imported directly
   - This simplifies the code and removes unnecessary type duplication

5. Cleaned up unused imports in benchmarking/metrics.rs:
   - Removed the unused `debug` import from the tracing module
   - Removed the unused `warn` import from the top-level scope (it's only used in the validations submodule)
   - Removed the `#[allow(unused_imports)]` attribute since all imports are now used
   - Verified that there are no more unused import warnings when building with benchmarking feature
   - This helps maintain clean imports and prevents future confusion

6. Cleaned up Cargo.toml dependencies:
   - Removed several unused dependencies:
     - crossbeam-channel = "0.5.14"
     - parking_lot = "0.12.3"
     - sysinfo = "0.33.1"
     - enum-map = { version = "2.7.3", features = [], optional = true }
   - Kept futures = "0.3.31" as it is used in process_pool.rs
   - Fixed the benchmarking feature to no longer depend on enum-map since it's not actually used
   - Maintained the benchmark feature as an alias to benchmarking for backward compatibility
   - Added comments to document the removed dependencies
   - This reduces the build dependencies and improves compile times


## Findings

### Known Issues:
- Duplicate implementation of `get_active_tasks` in worker.rs and image.rs
- Unused file worker.rs that isn't imported anywhere
- Multiple instances of code marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` that may not be needed
- Unused imports in benchmarking/metrics.rs
- Several unused dependencies in Cargo.toml

### Technical Insights:
- The codebase uses conditional compilation with the `benchmarking` feature flag for performance testing
- There appears to be good code organization with clear separation of concerns
- The API endpoints are well-defined in the commands directory
- The error handling seems consistent throughout the codebase
- Some dependencies were imported but not actually used in the codebase
- The benchmarking feature was incorrectly configured to depend on enum-map, which wasn't actually used
- The futures crate is necessary for async operations, particularly in the process pool
