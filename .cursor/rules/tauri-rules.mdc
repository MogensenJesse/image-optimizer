# Tauri rules

- Always ask before changing or adding packages
- Never use Tailwind
- Never use Typescript
- Use Powershell commands for terminal operations
- The UI is rendered with Webview2 on Windows or Webkit on Macos, no need for other prefixes
- This is a desktop app, the UI doesn't need to be responsive
