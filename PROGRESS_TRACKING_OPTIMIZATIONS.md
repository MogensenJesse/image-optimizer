# Process Pool Optimization & Worker Pool Removal

## Progress Summary

Legend:
üîÑ = In Progress
‚ö†Ô∏è = Blocked/Has Issues
‚úÖ = Completed

### Current Status:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Worker Pool adds unnecessary overhead
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Process Pool lacks direct task processing capabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Benchmarking shows worker abstraction is inefficient

### Next Implementation Steps:
1. Move benchmarking to process pool
2. Enhance process pool with task queuing
3. Update ImageOptimizer to use process pool directly
4. Remove worker pool and clean up dependencies

   - Update main initialization
   [ ] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Remove worker pool imports
    - Update module declarations
    - Remove worker-related tests

## Implementation Notes
- Make changes incrementally, one file at a time
- Keep error messages consistent with existing ones
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Don't overcomplicate things, keep it simple and functional
- Ensure proper cleanup after each code move

## Completed Tasks

## Findings

### Known Issues:
- Worker pool adds unnecessary synchronization overhead
- Multiple layers of abstraction impact performance
- Benchmarking shows minimal benefit from worker abstraction

### Technical Insights:
- Process pool is the main performance determinant
- Direct task processing is more efficient
- Batch size and process count are key performance factors
- Benchmarks show worker pool overhead (~0.1s for small images, ~1s for large images)
