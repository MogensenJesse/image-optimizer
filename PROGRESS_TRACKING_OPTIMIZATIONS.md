## Completed Tasks

## Findings

### Known Issues:
- Worker pool adds unnecessary synchronization overhead
- Multiple layers of abstraction impact performance
- Benchmarking shows minimal benefit from worker abstraction
- Benchmarking module contains tight coupling with worker pool
- AppState has direct worker pool dependency
- Error handling is tightly coupled with worker pool

### Technical Insights:
- Process pool is the main performance determinant
- Direct task processing is more efficient
- Batch size and process count are key performance factors
- Benchmarks show worker pool overhead (~0.1s for small images, ~1s for large images)
- Process pool metrics need expansion to handle task tracking
- Shutdown handling needs to be preserved during migration
- Error types need consolidation after worker removal
