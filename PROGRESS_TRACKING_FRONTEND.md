# Progress tracking - Frontend Cleanup

## Progress Summary

Legend:
üîÑ = In Progress
‚ö†Ô∏è = Blocked/Has Issues
‚úÖ = Completed

### Current Status:
‚úÖ Completed all cleanup tasks

### Next Implementation Steps:
- Test the application to ensure all functionality still works as expected


## Implementation Plan

### 1. Clean up unused props and variables

[x] Remove unused props in ProgressBar component
   Short description: The status and lastOptimizedFile props are passed to ProgressBar but never used inside the component.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/components/ProgressBar.jsx
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Remove status from props destructuring
   - Remove lastOptimizedFile from props destructuring
   - Update component JSDoc to remove these props from documentation
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable):
    - Update any component prop calls to remove these props when ProgressBar is used

[x] Remove unused state in TitleBar component
   Short description: The isMaximized state and related window resize event listeners are never used in the UI
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/components/TitleBar.jsx
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Remove isMaximized state declaration
   - Remove the useEffect that listens for window resize events
   - Remove appWindow.isMaximized() calls
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable):
    - Ensure the cleanup function in the useEffect is properly removed

### 2. Clean up unnecessary imports

[x] Remove unnecessary React import in ProgressBar
   Short description: In modern JSX transformation, importing React is not required when just using JSX.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/components/ProgressBar.jsx
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Remove the line `import React from "react";`
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None

[x] Clean up unused imports in App.jsx
   Short description: Review and remove any imports that aren't directly used in the component.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/App.jsx
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Review and potentially optimize the useRef import if only used indirectly
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None

### 3. Remove unused dependencies

[x] Remove react-dropzone package
   Short description: The react-dropzone package is included in package.json but not used anywhere in the codebase. The app uses Tauri's native drag-drop events instead.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: package.json
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Remove the line `"react-dropzone": "^14.3.5",` from package.json
   - Run `npm install` to update package-lock.json
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None

### 4. Fix CSS issues

[x] Remove empty CSS rule in TitleBar styles
   Short description: The .window-control-close:hover {} selector doesn't contain any styles.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/assets/styles/components/_TitleBar.scss
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Remove the empty `.window-control-close:hover {}` selector
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None

### 5. Optimize performance

[x] Memoize the calculateGradientColor function in FloatingMenu
   Short description: The calculateGradientColor function is recalculated often and could be memoized for performance.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/components/FloatingMenu.jsx
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Use useMemo or useCallback to memoize the calculateGradientColor function
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None

[x] Simplify FloatingMenu resize state
   Short description: The resize functionality has a maintainAspect property that is always set to true but never actually used.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/components/FloatingMenu.jsx
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Remove the maintainAspect property if it's not being used anywhere
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None

[x] Optimize state updates in useProgressTracker
   Short description: Multiple state updates in useProgressTracker.js could be consolidated to avoid unnecessary rerenders.
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src/hooks/useProgressTracker.js
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   - Review areas where multiple state updates happen and consolidate when possible
   - Look for opportunities to use functional updates to ensure latest state
   [x] Cleanup after moving code (if applicable): None


## Implementation Notes
- Make changes incrementally, one file at a time
- Keep error messages consistent with existing ones
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Don't overcomplicate things, keep it simple and functional
- Ensure proper cleanup after each code move



## Completed Tasks

### Clean up unused props and variables (‚úÖ)
- Removed unused status and lastOptimizedFile props from ProgressBar component
- Removed isMaximized state and resize event listeners from TitleBar component

### Clean up unnecessary imports (‚úÖ)
- Removed unnecessary React import from ProgressBar
- Removed unused useRef import from App.jsx

### Remove unused dependencies (‚úÖ)
- Removed react-dropzone from package.json

### Fix CSS issues (‚úÖ)
- Removed empty CSS rule in TitleBar styles (.window-control-close:hover)

### Optimize performance (‚úÖ)
- Memoized the calculateGradientColor function in FloatingMenu using useMemo
- Removed unused maintainAspect property from FloatingMenu resize state
- Optimized state updates in useProgressTracker with better comments and functional updates


## Findings

### Known Issues:
- Unused props in components that could be removed
- Unused state and event listeners in TitleBar component
- Empty CSS rules that serve no purpose
- Potential performance optimizations with memoization
- Redundant properties in state objects
- The react-dropzone package is included in dependencies but not used in the code

### Technical Insights:
- The codebase is generally well-structured with clear component responsibilities
- The app uses a custom hook (useProgressTracker) for managing complex state logic
- Most dependencies in package.json appear to be actively used
- The app uses Tauri's native drag-drop events (`tauri://drag-drop`, `tauri://drag-enter`, `tauri://drag-leave`) instead of react-dropzone for file upload functionality
- The maintainAspect property is used in the Rust backend but not in the frontend FloatingMenu component
