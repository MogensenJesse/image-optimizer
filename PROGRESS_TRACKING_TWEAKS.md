# Image Processing System Optimizations

## Progress Summary

Legend:
🔄 = In Progress
⚠️ = Blocked/Has Issues
✅ = Completed

### Current Status:
- System functional but has room for performance improvements

- Uneven worker task distribution

### Next Implementation Steps:
1. Dynamic process pool sizing
2. Improved batch size configuration
3. Parallel chunk processing
4. Worker task distribution balancing
5. Process warmup and reuse
6. Memory limit optimization

## Implementation Plan

   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src-tauri/src/processing/optimizer.rs
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   ```rust
   impl ProcessPool {
       pub fn new(app: tauri::AppHandle) -> Self {
           let optimal_processes = (num_cpus::get() / 2).max(2).min(8);
           Self::new_with_size(app, optimal_processes)
       }
   }
   ```
   [ ] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Update ImageOptimizer creation

   async fn process_chunks(&self, tasks: Vec<ImageTask>) {
       let chunk_futures: FuturesUnordered<_> = tasks
           .chunks(self.batch_size)
           .map(|chunk| self.process_chunk(chunk.to_vec()))
           .collect();
       
       while let Some(result) = chunk_futures.next().await {
           // Handle results
       }
   }
   ```
   [ ] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Update error handling
    - Ensure proper resource cleanup

   Files to modify: src-tauri/src/worker/pool.rs
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   ```rust
   impl WorkerPool {
       fn calculate_tasks_per_worker(&self, total_tasks: usize) -> usize {
           (total_tasks as f32 / self.worker_count as f32).ceil() as usize
       }
   }
   ```
   [ ] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Update task assignment logic
    - Adjust worker metrics

   ```rust
   impl ProcessPool {
       async fn ensure_warm_processes(&self, min_count: usize) {
           while self.active_count.load(Ordering::Relaxed) < min_count {
               if let Ok(process) = self.spawn_process().await {
                   self.warm_processes.lock().await.push(process);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   [ ] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Add process cleanup
    - Update metrics tracking

### 6. Memory Management

[ ] Optimize memory limits
   Short description: Scale memory usage based on system capacity
   Prerequisites: None
   Files to modify: src-tauri/src/processing/optimizer.rs
   External dependencies: None
   Code to add/change/remove/move:
   ```rust
   impl ImageOptimizer {
       fn get_memory_config(&self) -> (usize, f32) {
           let available = self.get_available_memory();
           let percentage = if available > 16_000_000_000 { 0.7 } else { 0.5 };
           (available, percentage)
       }
   }
   ```
   [ ] Cleanup after moving code:
    - Update batch size calculations
    - Adjust memory metrics

## Implementation Notes
- Each optimization can be implemented independently
- Focus on maintaining stability while improving performance
- Keep error handling consistent
- Preserve existing API contracts
- Test with various batch sizes and image counts

## Technical Insights:
- Current memory usage is very low (31MB peak for 72 images)
- Process pool is underutilized (only 1-4 processes used)
- Worker distribution is uneven (3/2 split)
- Chunk processing is sequential
- Process startup overhead impacts small batches
